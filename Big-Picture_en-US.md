# **Mould Ambition**

### **Improve efficiency**

> Interface Builder

The motivation and starting point of **Mould** is the author's deep hatred for the handwritten UI.

As the original element of **Mould**, Interface Builder can help engineers create GUI with what you see is what you get.

<br/>

### **Reduce Difficulty**

**Mould** has powerful GUI prototyping abilities, so that anyone who has no GUI development knowledge can build his own GUI  using drag n drop.

<br/>

### **Speed Up Workflow**

> Work Autonomy between Designer and Engineer

We can reformulate the workflow of GUI based on **Mould**. 
After the architect finish the skeleton of the GUI application, designers and engineers can work on subsequent design and development in parallel.

Designers' output can be shipped into production directly, no longer relying on the engineers' working.
And the repeated revising of vision and interaction will no longer cause trouble to the engineer.

Engineers don't have to wait for the design ready, they can run development immediately without worrying about the fidelity problem of UI and design.

<br/>

### **Build A More Powerful Design System**

> More than Design System

**Mould** believes that the design system should not drag their feet on Design Token. It should entirely control the design concept and interactive experience behind a brand.

Each brand can build a UED team in which designers and engineers work closely with Self-hosted **Mould** to create a highly consistent brand impression and user experience globally.

<br/>

### **Cross-end**

> Learn once, write everywhere

**Mould** focuses on the work of the GUI. Resolved the complexity caused by the inconsistency on the UI side at different ends, while receiving the differences in application architecture and ecosystem at each end.

Meanwhile, make cross-end development simple and retain the features of each end.

<br/>

### **Localization**

>  From International to Localization

**Mould** has the powerful content customization capabilities. 

With **Mould**, it will implement that provide customized content and interaction for people with different cultural background.

And **Mould** has more comprehensive thinking in this point, it allows the customized applications to be continuously and safely follow the main application for version upgrades without compatibility issues.
